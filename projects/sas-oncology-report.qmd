# Oncology Report (SAS)

This project demonstrates how to create a demographic table in SAS using `PROC REPORT`.

## Example Code

```sas
PROC REPORT DATA=adsl NOWD;
    COLUMN age sex race;
RUN;
```

## Explanation

In clinical trials, demographic tables are a common deliverable. This example highlights a basic report that could be part of a larger Clinical Study Report (CSR).
