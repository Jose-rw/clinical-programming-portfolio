# Clinical Trial Analysis Flow (CDISC)

This section documents the full process of a regulatory-compliant clinical trial analysis, following CDISC standards.

## Step 1: Raw Data

This includes:
- Demographics (age, sex, treatment group)
- Clinical Events (relapse, recurrence, etc.)
- Disposition (dropout, completion)
- Time-to-event (TTE) data

## Step 2: Create SDTM

SDTM datasets produced:
- `DM` - Demographics
- `CE` - Clinical Events
- `DS` - Disposition

## Step 3: Create ADaM

ADaM datasets produced:
- `ADTTE` - Time to Event dataset (ready for survival analysis)

## Step 4: TFL Generation

TFLs produced:
- **Table:** Population summary table (age, sex, etc.)
- **Listing:** List of key events per patient
- **Figure:** Kaplan-Meier survival plot

## Step 5: Final Report

All the above will be combined into this page and made available in the portfolio.
