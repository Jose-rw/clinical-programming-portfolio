# Bioinformatics Analysis Flow (Gene Expression & Survival)

This section documents a full bioinformatics analysis pipeline combining gene expression data and clinical survival data.

## Step 1: Raw Data

This includes:
- Gene expression data (`GSE7390_expression.csv`)
- Clinical metadata (`GSE7390_metadata.csv`)

## Step 2: Preprocessing

- Quality Control (removal of low-expression genes)
- Normalization (log2 transformation or z-score)

## Step 3: Exploratory Analysis

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Clustering (heatmap or unsupervised clustering)

## Step 4: Differential Expression Analysis

- Compare gene expression between survivors and non-survivors
- Identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

## Step 5: Combined Modeling

- Multivariate Cox model incorporating both clinical covariates and DEGs

## Step 6: TFL Generation

TFLs produced:
- **Table:** Top 10 survival-associated genes
- **Listing:** Patient list with molecular and clinical features
- **Figure:** Heatmap of expression by clinical group

## Step 7: Final Report

All the above will be combined into this page and made available in the portfolio.
