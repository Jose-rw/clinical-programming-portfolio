# Survival Analysis (R)

This project demonstrates Kaplan-Meier estimation using `survival` and `ggplot2` in R.

## Example Code

```r
library(survival)
library(ggplot2)

km_fit <- survfit(Surv(AVAL, CNSR) ~ TRTP, data = adtte)
ggsurvplot(km_fit)
```

## Explanation

Survival analysis is a key analysis in oncology trials, especially for endpoint analysis like Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS).
