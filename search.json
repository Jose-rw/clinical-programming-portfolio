    "text": "About Me\nMy journey started in Electronic Engineering, but I soon realized I wanted to work closer to the healthcare field. That’s how I transitioned into Biomedical Engineering, combining technology with a passion for health.\nFrom the beginning, my work always revolved around data analysis — first in hardware (processor data), then in business intelligence, and finally in clinical trials. This constant evolution helped me develop both technical programming skills and a strong sense of how data can tell the story of a product’s development.\nWhat truly inspires me is seeing how clinical trial data reflects the real-world impact a treatment can have — from initial data cleaning and reporting, to seeing that product eventually reach the market and help thousands of people.\n\nEvery dataset is a story of lives transformed — and I’m proud to help write those stories."

Traditional waterfall models are being replaced with Scrum-inspired approaches, where cross-functional teams collaborate continuously.\n\nSprint-based programming (TFL production in cycles).\nEarly validation and continuous feedback.\nCollaboration between data management, programming, and biostatistics.\n\nThis section will grow as I continue exploring and applying Agile methodologies in clinical programming."
