# ðŸ“Š Survival Analysis: Theory and Applications

## What is Survival Analysis?

Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that deals with the **analysis of time-to-event data**. In clinical trials, the *event* usually refers to a specific outcome such as **death**, **disease recurrence**, **recovery**, or **relapse**. The goal is to analyze **the time it takes for the event to occur**, while accounting for the fact that not all participants may experience the event during the study period (censoring).

## Why is Survival Analysis Important in Clinical Trials?

In many medical studies, especially in oncology and chronic disease research, it is not sufficient to know whether a patient experienced an event, but **when** the event happened is crucial. 

Survival analysis allows us to:

- **Estimate the probability of surviving past a certain time point.**
- **Compare survival rates between treatment groups.**
- **Assess the effect of covariates (e.g., age, treatment, biomarkers) on survival.**
- **Handle censored data**, where the outcome is not observed for all patients (e.g., lost to follow-up).

## How is Survival Analysis Performed?

### 1. **From SDTM to ADaM: Preparing the Data**

In clinical trials, survival analysis typically starts from SDTM datasets such as:

- **AE (Adverse Events)** for event-related data.
- **DS (Disposition)** to identify death or discontinuation dates.
- **EX (Exposure)** for treatment start and end dates.

These SDTM datasets are transformed into ADaM datasets, especially:

- **ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset)**: contains baseline and demographic information.
- **ADAE (Analysis of Adverse Events Dataset)**: provides detailed event information.
- **ADTTE (Time-to-Event Dataset)**: specialized dataset to analyze survival or time-to-event outcomes.

### 2. **Defining Time and Event Variables**

- **Time-to-event**: typically derived as the number of days from randomization/treatment start (e.g., TRTSDT) to the event date or censoring date (e.g., DTHDT, LSTALVDT).
- **Event indicator**: binary variable (1=event occurred, 0=censored).

### 3. **Analysis in SAS and R**

Both SAS and R allow estimation of survival functions and hazard models:

#### In **SAS**:
- `PROC LIFETEST`: Kaplan-Meier estimation, log-rank test.
- `PROC PHREG`: Cox Proportional Hazards model.

#### In **R**:
- `survival` package: `survfit()` for Kaplan-Meier, `coxph()` for Cox model.

## What Results Are Expected and How to Interpret Them?

### Variables and Outputs:
- **Kaplan-Meier survival curves**: Estimated survival probabilities over time.
- **Median survival time**: Time by which 50% of patients are expected to experience the event.
- **Hazard Ratio (HR)**: Comparing risk between groups, with confidence intervals.
- **Log-Rank test p-value**: To determine if survival curves differ significantly.

### Example of Interpretation:
- **HR < 1**: Treatment reduces the risk of event compared to control.
- **HR > 1**: Treatment increases the risk.
- **95% CI**: If it does not include 1, the result is statistically significant.
- **Kaplan-Meier plot**: Visual representation of survival probability over time by group.

## Key Concepts and Definitions

### 1. **Time-to-Event Data**
- Data measuring the duration until a specified event occurs.
- Example: Time from randomization to death.

### 2. **Censoring**
- Occurs when we do not observe the event for a patient during the study period.
- Types:
  - **Right censoring**: Patient leaves the study or the study ends before the event occurs.
  - **Left censoring**: Event occurs before observation begins (less common in clinical trials).

### 3. **Survival Function (S(t))**
- Probability of surviving beyond time t.
- Mathematically: \( S(t) = P(T > t) \)

### 4. **Hazard Function (h(t))**
- Instantaneous risk of experiencing the event at time t, given survival up to time t.
- Mathematically: \( h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T < t+\Delta t \mid T \geq t)}{\Delta t} \)

## Common Statistical Methods

### 1. **Kaplan-Meier Estimator**
- Non-parametric method to estimate the survival function.
- Accounts for censored data.

### 2. **Log-Rank Test**
- Statistical test to compare survival curves of two or more groups.

### 3. **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**
- Semiparametric model to estimate the effect of covariates on survival time.

### 4. **Parametric Models**
- Survival models assuming a specific distribution for survival times (e.g., exponential, Weibull).

## Example: Survival in Oncology

Consider a clinical trial comparing a new chemotherapy vs. standard therapy:

| Time (months) | Censoring (0=event, 1=censored) | Group (New/Standard) |
|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| 10            | 0                              | New                 |
| 15            | 1                              | New                 |
| 7             | 0                              | Standard            |
